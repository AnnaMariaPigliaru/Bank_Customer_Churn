# Bank Customer Churn
*Exploratory Data Analysis of an European Bank's Customer Churn patterns*

## 1. Project Background

The dataset used for the following project was provided by Maven Analytics and it comprises account information of 10,000 customers  from an undisclosed European Bank. The Bank’s Marketing Team requests to identify possible causes of impact on customer retention. As a data analyst, I have carried out an EDA on the data with the aim to discover and  thoroughly synthesize Customer Churn patterns and trends. Based on the available information, insights and recommendations are drawn by applying these types of Market Segmentation:
- **Demographic Segmentation**: based on available objective information (gender, age, income, ext.)
- **Geographical Segmentation**: where the customers are located (country)
- **Behavioral Segmentation**: how the client makes use of the services (product quantity, activity, tenure)

### 1.1 Data Structure
The dataset’s structure as seen below consists of 2 tables: Customer_info and Account_info with a total row count of 20,002 records. The dataset was cleaned and relieved of duplicates and considerable outliers.

### 1.2 Data Analysis
Excel was the tool used for the data cleaning and transformation. A dashboard was developed to offer the Marketing Team the opportunity to globally monitor customer retention. All can be viewed [View Here](Bank_Churn_Clean.xlsx)
